### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The best way to name variables in javaScript is to make them consice, however descriptive. Simply using random letters to identify different variables makes the code hard for others to understand, and can lead to the mis-use or swapping of accidental variables. Similarly, having very lengthy names impairs a user ability to easily follow along with what is happening in the code.
2. Java and JavaScript are in fact very differnet. While Java is a very powerful and complex language, JavaScript is in ways simpler, and a loosely-typed language. Similarly, Java must be compiled before the application can run, while JavaScript is interpreted in the browser itself.
3. The addition of comments is key for clear organization of the code. While they shouldn'e be used unnessisarily, they are helpful to add to sections of code that are complex and lengthy. Comments can be added either in single lines, or as entire block/paragraph in both HTML and JavaScript.
